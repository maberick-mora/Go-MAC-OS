Go for Mac-Os ssh utility.

Purpose
-------
The `go-setup.sh` and `go` scripts are designed to facilitate the setup of SSH connections and automate the installation of Homebrew and sshpass on macOS systems. The setup script (`go-setup.sh`) installs Homebrew if it's not already installed, installs sshpass using Homebrew, sets up environment variables, and defines an alias for the `go` script. The `go` script connects to a remote server via SSH using a pre-configured password stored in an encrypted file.

Prerequisites
-------------
- macOS operating system
- Internet connection
- Access to Terminal

Installation
------------
1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Terminal and navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
3. Make the scripts executable:

   chmod 750 go-setup.sh go

Security Considerations
Keep the encrypted_password.txt file secure and avoid sharing it with others.
Ensure that the password file is stored in a safe location and is not accessible to unauthorized users.
Be cautious when using SSH passwords instead of SSH keys for authentication.

Disclaimer
The authors of these scripts are not responsible for any misuse or unauthorized access resulting from the use of these tools. Users are advised to use these scripts responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
